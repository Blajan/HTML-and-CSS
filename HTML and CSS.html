        <h1>What is success?</h1>
        <p>
          What does success mean? The concept of success is a very vague one and quite difficult to count or identify in certain situations. 
          Even if we all know the term and think we know what it means, it is difficult to assign a specific definition to success.
          Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success. If you like what you do, then you will be successful.
          And that's basically because it's a often subjective notion. There are people for whom success means to have a happy family, a fulfilled personal life.
          For others, success means money and well-being, while some people aim to be the best in what professional life means.
          There are also fears for which success means to constantly overcome their limits. 
          To climb the top of a mountain, to jump by parachute or to make a hard route on a river whirling with a canoe.
          The fact is that to count success means to take some benchmarks, to be based on a scale of values. 
          If success means wealth to you, you need to know who you are comparing yourself to. 
          Because what a lot of money means to you, to some of the world's rich, maybe it just means spending money on clothes in a year.
          While any level of success in any area of life can be full of accomplishments for a person, success should still mean something more. 
          Going over to understand it by getting good results, this term should define more than just running by being a millionaire, while everything around is neglected, left in the background. 
          Life should be seen as a whole, as an adventure in which results from a certain field contribute to our overall development.

      <h2>About me</h2>
      <div class="about_text">
        <p>My name is Blajan Razvan, I am 23 years old, I am Romanian and I am an optimistic person and eager to digest useful information for my development.<br>             
          I am hungry to grow, to develop, I am hungry to enrich my skills.<br>In the last year I have rediscovered myself and found my way in life.
          I found that I like to learn, this fulfills me and makes me proud of myself.<br>
          I believe that when a person stops growing, that person is doomed to failure, and I do not accept being in that category.<br>
          I hate capping, I hate wasting my time, I don't want to be in an environment that doesn't force me to grow up, 
          I run away from such things and I think that this thing will bring me many benefits.<br>
          This would be a brief characterization of me. I hope I managed to arouse interest and I hope you will contact me to collaborate.
